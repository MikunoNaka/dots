# Dots
These are my dotfiles, they include things like window manager configs and text editor or shell configs and probably even configs from other programs! woah

Idk if I need to licence config files so I'll leave it like that for now. You can check out these files and do really whatever with it.

If you don't know what dotfiles or window managers are, just do a
> sudo apt install bspwm sxhkd

> sudo pacman -S bspwm sxhkd

> sudo dnf install bspwm sxhkd

Whichever seems more familiar, run that one in your terminal and magic will happen
